# MetaLoc

An experiment of MetaWatch and Google Maps.

# Usage

Please install MetaWatch Manager first (requires 0.2.4 or later). The manager could be obtained from [MetaWatch](http://metawatch.org/).

Open the app on the handset and it'll keep update last known location. Hit start button to start send maps to your watch. Please note that you'll need internet connection the whole time for obtaining Google Maps images.

# Known Bugs

Due to the bug in the MWM 0.2.4 (it send wrong signal to watch for "Stop Application Mode", in fact, it sends the oppositeâ€¦), you may notice that your watch is not responding even if you hit Stop button. You'll need to Stop and re-Start your MetaWatch Manager to get your watch return to idle mode.
